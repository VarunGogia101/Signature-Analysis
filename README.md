# SigNet
SigNet (Detecting Signature Similarity using Machine Learning/Deep Learning): Is this the end of Human Forensic Analysis?

# How
To build our Signature Similarity network, we will use utilize the wonders of Deep Learning. We will go through three approaches to extract the similarity between our handwritten signatures.

# Requirements
For this project we will require:
- Python 3.8: The Programming Language
- TensorFlow 2: The Deep Learning Library
- Numpy: Linear Algebra
- Matplotlib: Plotting imagesÂ 
- Scikit-Learn: General Machine Learning Library
